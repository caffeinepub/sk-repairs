  "summary": "REQ-7 is not clearly implemented as specified: the diff does not show an XPath-targeted, isolated blue styling change for a single button with hover/focus/disabled states. Additionally, the diff appears to introduce other blue styling outside the requested button, and it modifies non-requested meta/state files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Update ONLY the selected button element at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/button[1] to use a blue color styling (blue background plus hover/focus-visible/disabled styles) while keeping existing size, icon/text, and behavior unchanged.",
      "reason": "The provided diff snippet for JobsDashboardPage.tsx is truncated and does not show a targeted change to the specific button at the given XPath, nor does it show explicit hover/focus-visible/disabled blue styling for that one button. Therefore the requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the diff evidence.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Introduced/changed additional blue styling outside the single targeted button (e.g., stats card text using Tailwind 'text-blue-600').",
      "reason": "The request explicitly says not to apply a global blue theme or change other elements; the diff shows at least one other element styled blue.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/JobsDashboardPage.tsx (truncated): contains `text-blue-600` on a stats value"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated repository meta/documentation/state summary files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked for a UI styling tweak to one button and did not request updating summary/state files.",
